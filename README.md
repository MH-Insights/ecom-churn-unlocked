# Ecom Churn Unlocked

**Lifecycle segmentation, churn risk modeling, and discount strategy insights** using an open-source eCommerce dataset. Built to reflect product analytics workflows and translate behavioral signals into clear recommendations.

## Project Overview

This notebook simulates the day-to-day work of a Product Analytics Lead by surfacing user behavior patterns and translating them into actionable strategies for growth, retention, and monetization. It demonstrates how to move from raw engagement data to prioritized lifecycle interventions.

## Core Analyses

- Segment users by lifecycle stage (new, retained, power, at-risk)
- Identify churn-risk cohorts and investigate behavioral patterns
- Evaluate discount effectiveness across tiers and satisfaction levels
- Assess alignment between satisfaction and spending
- Model power users using frequency, recency, and spend thresholds
- Recommend segment-specific strategies by city and membership tier

## Why This Matters

Strong product analytics goes beyond tracking metrics. This project demonstrates how to:

- Translate behavior into strategy and team decision-making
- Identify levers for retention-led growth and activation design
- Align insights with product, marketing, and lifecycle goals

It is designed to showcase decision-quality insights to cross-functional stakeholders, especially in early- and mid-stage product environments.

## Dataset

- Source: [E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset)
- Cleaned and prepared to simulate product usage signals relevant to lifecycle marketing and retention analytics

## Possible Extensions

- Add a churn prediction model (e.g. logistic regression)
- Run clustering to identify latent user segments
- Visualize lifecycle drop-offs in a dashboard environment

## About This Project

This notebook was built to showcase analytical thinking, lifecycle insight development, and behavioral framing for teams that rely on product analytics to scale. It is particularly relevant to hiring teams evaluating candidates for strategic analytics, product insights, or lifecycle growth roles.
